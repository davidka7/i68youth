          i68 is the youth ministry of Church of the Living God. Our goal and
          earnest desire is to see thousands of young people transformed by our
          ministry. We want to help equip young people with the right mentality
          to be able to overcome the pressures of their flesh, and the constant
          pressures of this dark world. God wants to cleanse us and make us into
          a holy nation and we put a strong emphasis on working on ourselves so
          that we can be those pure vessels that God can use. We know that this
          is a difficult and hard process but we willingly choose to take part
          in this long operation. Our characters are changed, habits are broken,
          chains are breached, and hearts are healed. We believe that God has
          called us to be modern-day John the Baptists. We refuse to compromise
          the Word of God and make it something that it is not. We will not take
          the easy road. We firmly believe in reading God’s Word everyday and
          letting it transform the way that we think. We pray, both individually
          and corporately, and believe that we will see revival as a result of
          our prayers! We are constantly convicted by God’s Word and this
          conviction won’t allow us to live a quiet and selfish life. We choose
          to put the Word into action by preaching the Gospel wherever we
          possibly can. That is the goal every single one of us is striving
          towards!
